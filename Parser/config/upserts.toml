# Below is an example of an upsert
# https://www.sqlite.org/lang_UPSERT.html
# Note that an upsert is already generated for each column with the full primary key as on conflict clause
#
# []
#   It starts with a mandatory comment, which looks like this: [my comment].
#
# [table]
#   The name of the table you want the upsert to generated for
#
# [columns_to_update]
#   The updates that are included in the ON CONFLICT clause
#
# [func_name]
#   The Swift function name to generate
#
# EXAMPLE
#
# [user-first-name]
#   table = "User"
#   columns_to_update = ["firstName"]
#   func_name = "updateFirstName"
